# Causal Inference Methods in Economics

**Author**: Gavin Qu

Applied causal inference techniques from an Economics Masters course (EC963), implemented in Python. Each notebook replicates a classic empirical study using modern econometric methods.

## Methods Overview

- **Randomized Experiments**: The gold standard for causal inference. Random assignment ensures treatment and control groups are comparable in expectation.
- **Matching**: Constructs a comparison group by pairing treated units with similar untreated units based on observed covariates, under the Conditional Independence Assumption.
- **Difference-in-Differences**: Compares changes over time between treated and control groups, identifying causal effects under the parallel trends assumption.
- **Instrumental Variables**: Addresses endogeneity by using an exogenous source of variation (instrument) that affects the outcome only through the treatment.
- **Regression Discontinuity**: Exploits a known threshold in a continuous assignment variable, comparing units just above and below the cutoff.

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```
